In IIITV-ICD's coding enclave, Dcodr faced a challenge: find the shortest subarray summing to a target.If many subarray exists,return the last one.This moment echoed Dcodr's legacy â€” a tale of coding precision and relentless pursuit of excellence, where algorithms dance and success echoes through every line of code, creating a symphony of accomplishment.

If such a subarray does not exist,print nothing.

Input Format

The first line contains the size of the array, N.
The second line contains the sum, S.
The third line contains N positive integers.

Constraints

0 <= N <= 10^7
0 <= S <= 10^5
0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

Output Format

Print a sub-array.
