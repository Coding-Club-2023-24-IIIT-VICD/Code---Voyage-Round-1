In the enchanting realm of IIITV-ICD, a sacred array of n mystical numbers holds the key to ancient secrets. This array is represented by an array of integers known as "nums."

As a skilled array magician within IIITV-ICD, you possess the extraordinary power to perform a series of operations. Each operation empowers you to select a magical subarray within the array and replace it with the sum of its enchanted elements. For instance, if the array is initially imbued with [1, 3, 5, 6], and you choose the subarray [3, 5], the array undergoes a transformation, resonating with newfound energy, becoming [1, 8, 6].

Now, your quest is to unravel the ancient mysteries of IIITV-ICD's array and determine the maximum length of a non-decreasing array that can be conjured through these magical operations. A non-decreasing array is one where every element is greater than or equal to its predecessor.

Total number of operations can be zero.

Input Format

First line of input contains total length of array N.
Second line contains N integers.

Constraints

0 <= N <= 10^6
0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

Output Format

Print single integer which denotes maximum length of non decreasing array after some operations.
